# Fastapi template

Boilerplate for project with fastapi, docker, github actions

## Local development

## Setting-up the local development environment
Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker-compose
- Pycharm Professional Edition (Docker integration is only available on this edition)


To run the app locally, use the docker compose file in the root dir

1. Create `.env` file using the template `.env.sample` on the project root directory
2. Run docker-compose to spin up the containers
```bash
docker-compose up
```
**Note:** The .env file is loaded by default. So there is no need to use `--env-file` flag for pointing the env file.
3. When the containers are running double check if the app is being served on your local by visiting this URL:

    http://localhost:8000/healthy

4. Setup Pycharm to use the interpreter inside the running containers

5. `Preferences -> Python Interpreter -> (Cog icon) Add -> Docker-compose`

6. Add the path mappings as project working directory in local pointing to the /app/ folder
7. Run a test to check if the configurations are working properly.
